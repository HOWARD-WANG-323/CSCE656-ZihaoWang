                        Howdy! I'm a graduate student from Computer Engineering and here are some reasons about why I choose this course: 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        1. I am deeply fascinated by new media and am eager to explore its impact on our daily lives and its role in transforming the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. I am curious to understand the integration of computers with new media and the historical evolution of this innovative technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. I aspire that the knowledge gained from this course will empower me to perceive the world through a fresh and enlightened perspective.
                    </p>
