                    <h5>Three Common Themes</h5> 
                    <p>1. The reasons for choosing this course are common. Most students chose this course because they are interested in multimedia and want to understand the practical application scenarios of multimedia, such as <a href="https://ziqiaojin.webnode.page/">Ziqiao Jin's Site</a> and <a href="https://kimberlykchen.wixsite.com/kimchencsce445">
Kimberly Chen's Site</a></p>
                    <p>2. Most students are social media users, and almost all students have their own instagram and youtube, such as <a href="https://people.tamu.edu/~kdaoq2819/">Khanh Dao's Site</a> and <a href="https://hdhulipala02.wixsite.com/website/home">Harshitha Dhulipala's Site</a></p>
                    <p>3. Everyone loves music very much, and the classification of music media types is also based on music styles. The popular common favorite music style is POP, such as <a href="https://people.tamu.edu/~benson221655/CS445">Benson Hsu's Site</a> and <a href="https://nehaam02.wixsite.com/mysite">Neha Manuel's Site</a></p>

                    <h5>What to Improve</h5> 
                    <p>I don't have any TV shows or movies that I like to watch on my website. Other students in the class introduced their favorite movie or TV media and detailed subject categories.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I also ignored some categories of text multimedia, such as novels.</p>
                    <P>I could revise my page to add more multimedia categories, such as movies and novels</P>
